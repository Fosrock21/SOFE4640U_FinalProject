# Hotel Booking App Prototype

A React Native prototype for a hotel booking application, built with Expo.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version is recommended)
- The [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go) app on your iOS or Android device.

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    If you are not already in it, navigate to the app's folder.
    ```bash
    cd HotelBookingApp
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    This command will install all the necessary packages for the project.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Running the Application

1.  **Start the development server:**
    This command starts the Expo Metro bundler. To ensure the best results, it's recommended to clear the cache on startup.
    ```bash
    npx expo start --clear
    ```

2.  **Open the app:**
    Scan the QR code displayed in the terminal using the Expo Go app on your device.
